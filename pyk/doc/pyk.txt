In Pyokki, .pyk files are treated like special .csv files. They differ from standard CSVs in the following ways:
* The delimiter between values is the character "|".
* Leading and trailing whitespace is removed from all values before they are processed.
* If a "|" is desired within a value, a backslash ("\") may be appended to it.
* Each line of the file is processed separately.
* A line with no delimiter instead treats each character as its own value.
* An empty line is ignored.
