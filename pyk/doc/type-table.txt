type/table.pyk is a table of type effectiveness.
The rows represent the attacking type and the columns represent the defending type.
Both the rows and columns use all types in the order they are defined in type/ptypes.pyk.

NOTE: This implementation assumes that creature types and damage types are the same. It is possible to create a system where they are separate (or rather, such that they act as if they are separate) but it requires some extraneous data in this file.
