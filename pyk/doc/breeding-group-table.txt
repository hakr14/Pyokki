breeding/group/table.pyk is a table of group breeding compatibilities.
Each row and column represents a group, and each spot represents whether the row group is compatible with the column group.
The row represents the group of the parent with the gender with higher priority.
Both the rows and columns use all genders in the order they are defined in breeding/group/groups.pyk.

WARNING: This implementation assumes all compatible genders have different priorities. Behavior for breeding with two genders of the same priority is not defined.
