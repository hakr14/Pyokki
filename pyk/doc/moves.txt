Each line of moves.pyk should be of the following format:

Name | Type | Category | PP | Power | Accuracy | Target | Wide | Flags | Additional

Type is a damage type defined in type/ptypes.pyk.
Category is a move category defined in categories.pyk.
PP and power are integers.
Accuracy is an integer representing the percentage accuracy of the move.
Target is explained in moves-target.txt.
Wide is a flag determining if the move hits all available targets.
Flags is a collection of single character flags. These are stored for use in "Additional", and in many other places (such as item interaction and abilities).
Additional is not yet implemented.
