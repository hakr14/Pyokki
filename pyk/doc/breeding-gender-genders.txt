Each line of breeding/gender/genders.pyk should be of the following format:

Name | Color | Priority | Only

Priority is an integer representing which parent's species should be passed to offspring.
For example, in a breeding between two genders of order 1 and 2, the offspring will have the species of the parent with gender priority 2.
Priority is also used for other purposes in breeding, such as determining which compatibility list to use for breeding groups (see breeding-group-table.txt).

Only is a flag that only gender requirements should be considered for breeding (i.e. group requirements are ignored).

Breeding compatibilities are handled separately in breeding/gender/table.pyk.
