Each line of stats.pyk should be of the following format:

Name|Abbreviation|Color|Short Name|Symbol|Hidden

If Short Name is empty, the short name of the stat will be the full name of the stat.
Symbol is expected to be a single character.
If Symbol is empty, the stat is assumed to have no symbol.
Hidden is an indication that the stat should not be represented in a stats layout of a creature.
If Hidden has any value, the stat is considered hidden.
If Hidden is empty or missing, the stat is assumed to not be hidden.
